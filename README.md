# Lethal Clips

Interfaces with the Steam timeline API to mark significant moments (currently only deaths) on your timeline. Useful for identifying potential clips when using Steam's built in game recording feature. This mod is currently just a proof-of-concept, but future updates will add more functionality and customizability.

> Currently, only 64-bit Windows is supported by this mod. Future updates are planned to bring broader compatibility.
